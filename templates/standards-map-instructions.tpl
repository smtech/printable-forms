<h1>Generate Standards Maps</h1>

<p>The process for generating a "nice" standards map is:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Install the bookmarklet, by dragging this bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar: <div class="bookmarklet"><a href="{$bookmarklet}">Generate Map</a></div></li>
	<li>Browse <a href="http://curricuplan.stmarksschool.org">CurricUplan</a> and&hellip;</li>
	<li>&hellip;while viewing an analysis, click the bookmarklet.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Nota bene:</em> the first time you click the bookmarklet, probably nothing will happen, because the browser is blocking pop-ups from CurricUplan. Look in your browser's location bar for an icon or message indicating that pop-up window was blocked and then allow pop-ups from CurricUplan.</p>

<p>Your mileage may vary, depending on what browser you use, as to what your print-outs look like. Chrome <em>seems</em> to be most reliable, as of August 2015, but that may vary wildly as time progresses.</p>

<p>Et voil&#224;!</p>
