# Printable Forms

[![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/smtech/printable-forms/badges/quality-score.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/smtech/printable-forms/?branch=master)

A mismatched collection of forms designed for printout. Their connective tissue is that they were all in process at the same time?

## Book List

`book-list.php` generates the textbook sign-out sheets that the bookstore distributes with new texts. Upload a properly formatted CSV file, print double-sided. Whee!

## Generate Map

`generate-map.php` is a combo bookmarklet and viewer. This scrapes CurricUplan curriculum maps for alignment data and then re-presents it in more visually-appealing (and understandable) form.

## Schedule

`schedule.php` is a form-driven formatter for St. Mark's schedules. It caches the data entered so that the URL of a page can be copied to return to that data at any time. It's mad slick -- and totally spaghetti code.
